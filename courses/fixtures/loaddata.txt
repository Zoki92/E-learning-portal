python manage.py loaddata subjects.json
By default, Django looks for files in the fixtures/ directory
 of each application, but you can specify the complete path to
  the fixture file for the loaddata command. You can also use the
   FIXTURE_DIRS setting to tell Django additional directories to 
   look for fixtures.
Fixtures are not only useful for setting up initial data, but also
 to provide sample data for your application or data required for your tests.
